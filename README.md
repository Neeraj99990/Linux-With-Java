## About the Project üåê

This project showcases how Java can interact with Linux systems by executing Linux commands from within Java applications. This capability allows developers to create powerful, platform-specific applications that can leverage Linux‚Äôs system utilities directly from Java code.

## Features üöÄ

- Execute various Linux commands (e.g., `ls`, `ps`, `df`) from Java
- Retrieve output directly into Java for processing or display
- Error handling for command execution failures
- Customizable commands and easy-to-extend framework

---

## Setup & Installation üîß

### Prerequisites
- **Linux OS**: The commands in this project are specific to Linux-based systems.
- **Java 8 or later**: Ensure Java is installed on your system. [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Linux-With-Java.git
   cd Linux-With-Java
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

---

## Usage üìù

You can customize and run Linux commands directly from the Java application by modifying the `executeCommand` method in the code.

### Example Code
```java
public class LinuxCommands {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String command = "ls -la"; // Linux command example
        try {
            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
            // Handle the output and errors here
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Examples üåü

| Command       | Description                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `ls -la`      | Lists files with detailed info      |
| `df -h`       | Shows disk usage in human-readable format |
| `ps aux`      | Displays all running processes      |
